About
====================
A 3-reel slot machine originally written sometime around 1996. There are a
number of different skins available for various clients.

Don't go expecting anything amazing from either the game or the gameplay. This
was created in the early days of the internet and rendering anything that moved
in a web browser was a huge achievement.

The reels on the slot machine are actually supposed to spin, but they were
based on a busy spin because at the time there was no way to accurately wait
for a fixed period of time or the next video frame. If they don't appear to
spin in your browser, it's probably because they are spinning too fast.

    
Pre-requisites
====================
1. Java compiler

You should be able to just drag one of the HTML files on to your browser window
and everything should magically work.

Support
====================
Absolutely none provided.
